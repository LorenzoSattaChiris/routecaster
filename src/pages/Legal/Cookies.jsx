          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, RouteCaster) are
          called &quot;first-party cookies.&quot; Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called &quot;third-party cookies.&quot;
          Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
          cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
          question and also when it visits certain other websites.

          Why do we use cookies?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate (these are known as &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly
          necessary&quot; cookies). Other cookies enable us to track and target
          the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
          Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes.

          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. This tool allows you to select which
          categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot
          be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
          services.

          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and

          Website; however, your access to some functionality and areas of our
          Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. We may also use other, similar technologies, such as web
          beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or &quot;clear
          gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
          identifier enabling us to recognize when someone has visited our
          Website or opened an email that includes them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This allows us, for example, to monitor traffic patterns between
          pages, deliver or communicate with cookies, understand if you arrived
          via an online advertisement, improve site performance, and measure the
          success of email marketing campaigns. In many cases, these
          technologies rely on cookies to function properly, so declining
          cookies may impair their functionality.
